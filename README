Flash/Ruby
==========

WARNING: This is not being actively maintained, but it was languishing
         inaccessible to anyone else, thought I'd put it up.
         It was last updated in 2005.

Prerequisites for building
--------------------------

  * Ruby 1.8 or newer + headers
  * libflash library 0.99.2 or newer + headers
  * Ruby GTK2 bindings

Build + Install
---------------

Flash/Ruby includes setup.rb for easy building and installation. To
build and install in one step:

  $ ruby setup.rb

Building
--------

If you just want to build:

  $ ruby setup.rb config
  $ ruby setup.rb setup
  
Installing
----------

To install a previously built source tree:

  $ ruby setup.rb install

Using
-----

The bindings wrap the two GObject classes exported by the libflash library, namely
FlashLibrary (representing a libflashplayer.so plugin file) and
FlashFile (representing a .swf file).

See the examples/ directory for some examples of usage.

Documentation
-------------

RDoc coverage exists for all publically exposed API methods.
To generate the documentation, run:

	$ ./tools/genrdoc
